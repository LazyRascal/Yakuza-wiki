    <p>"Judgment" is set in the fictional district of Kamurocho, which fans of the "Yakuza" series will recognize as a recurring location in those games. However, "Judgment" introduces a new protagonist and a distinct narrative.</p>
    <p>Protagonist:</p>
    
    <p>The main character is Takayuki Yagami, a former lawyer turned private detective.

The character is portrayed by Japanese actor Takuya Kimura, lending his likeness and voice to the in-game character.</p>

    <p>The central plot revolves around a string of murders that Yagami is hired to investigate. As he delves deeper into the case, he uncovers a web of conspiracy, corruption, and moral ambiguity. The narrative explores themes of justice, redemption, and the consequences of one's actions.</p>
